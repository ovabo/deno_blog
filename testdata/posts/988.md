## The Tangible Threats

Since June 11, 2023, my journey has taken a dark turn, overshadowed by forces both seen and unseen.

It's difficult enough to grapple with tangible threats, with voices that explicitly utter malice and hands that seek to harm. Phone calls and text messages laden with venom, covert threats veiled under the garb of 'concern,' and personal confrontations have become an unnerving part of my daily existence. In seeking justice, I turned to the legal avenues available to me, hopeful that the rule of law would protect me and restore some semblance of peace.

## When Reality Blurs with the Metaphysical

I've never been one to delve deeply into or believe the tales of African metaphysics. Yet, the events post-June 11 have shaken this skepticism. Strange occurrences, signals, feelings of being ensnared by a force beyond the tangible, have become a disturbing norm. And while my logical mind grapples with these experiences, there's a part of me that knows the root. Those who couldn't bind me with their physical threats have now resorted to metaphysical means to exert control and instill fear.

I feel besieged by forces beyond the veil of our known reality. My days are riddled with signals, symbols, and encounters that insinuates harm and doom. This period is so intense and opening my eyes to the eternal dance between life, death, and the many shades in between.

Life, as we know it, is a complex weave of experiences, beliefs, and emotions. It's an ever-evolving journey punctuated by moments of joy, sadness, introspection, and growth. For many, it is also interspersed with spiritual confrontations, where the boundaries between the physical and metaphysical blur, inviting challenges that test our mettle and shape our understanding of existence.


If anything happens to me, if I am silenced by this relentless onslaught, I leave behind this narrative as a testament. I want the world to ask questions, to demand answers, to ensure that those who have darkened my days since that fateful day in June are held accountable.

In every society, tales of vendetta and power plays, both physical and metaphysical, have prevailed. But we live in an age of reason, enlightenment, and justice. Even as forces beyond comprehension play their part, the world must not blind itself to the tangible culprits, to those who believe that fear is a weapon to be wielded at will.

While the metaphysical realm remains shrouded in mystery, the world of the living has its own duty. It is the duty of kinship, of humanity, and of justice. If my voice is silenced, may the echo of this narrative resonate, sparking questions, igniting debates, and most importantly, bringing the perpetrators into the light.
